Hello-world
===========

One of Facebook Parse integration tutorial brought me here,
Cloud Foundry, Stackato & Azure use GitHub all the times.
This is my first repo in GitHub. Kinda late comer, however
better late than never!
I am an adjunct lecturer, lecturing at FJU.
"Data Communications & Computer Networks" and
"Cloud Application Programming" are the two courses I lecture currently.
